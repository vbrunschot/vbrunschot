# OSCP Preparation
My current goal is to achieve the OSCP certificate. At time of writing (feb 2022) i rooted around 70, mostly easy, boxes on TryHackMe and HackTheBox. As i'm moving towards the medium and hard boxes i will now create write-ups for some of these boxes. Mostly as reference for myself and hopefully helping others along the way.
