# Hi i'm Marcel van Brunschot
Currently working as a Full Stack C# Developer and Security Engineer/Consultant.

Available for pentesting. Contact me at marcel.v.brunschot@outlook.com

My current goal is to achieve the OSCP certificate. At time of writing (feb 2022) I rooted around 70 boxes on TryHackMe and HackTheBox. As I'm moving towards the medium and hard boxes I'll start creating write-ups for some of these boxes and share them on GitHub. Mostly as reference for myself and hopefully helping others along the way.
