# Hi i'm Marcel van Brunschot
Currently working as Full Stack C# Developer, Data Engineer and Security Engineer/Consultant.

Available for pentesting. Contact me at marcel.v.brunschot@outlook.com

My current goal is to achieve the OSCP certificate. At time of writing (feb 2022) I rooted around 70 boxes on TryHackMe and HackTheBox. As i'm moving towards the medium and hard boxes I will now create write-ups for some of these boxes. Mostly as reference for myself and hopefully helping others along the way.
